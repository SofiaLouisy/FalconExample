This is a list of the things that needs to be done


+ Version handling with git and bitbucket
+ Link backside to frontside


+ In backside, make an update over HTTP that updates the page in different intervals 
(with PUT - update existing resource OR with POST - create new resource. For this, 
I need to check which one to use and how it can be done WITHOUT A REQUEST)



Further steps:

+ Deploy the server to a cloud service. Tweak so only Stickybit clients can access
