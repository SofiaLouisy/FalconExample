# To do

## To do

* Make frontside request backside
* Make a loop in fronside to request a post
* Connect backside to database
* Deploy the server to a cloud service. 
* Configure so only clients of Stickybit network can access

## Done
* Version handling with git and bitbucket





## Notes
* In backside, make an update over HTTP that updates the page in different intervals 
(with PUT - update existing resource OR with POST - create new resource. For this, 
I need to check which one to use and how it can be done WITHOUT A REQUEST)
