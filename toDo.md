# To do

## To do

* Create an Access-Control-Allow-Origin, so that my client can HTTP (and not HTTPS) to my server.
* Make frontside request backside
* Make a loop in fronside to request a post
* Connect backside to database
* Deploy the server to a cloud service. 
* Configure so only clients of Stickybit network can access



## Done
* Version handling with git and bitbucket





## Notes
* In backside, make an update over HTTP that updates the page in different intervals 
(with PUT - update existing resource OR with POST - create new resource. For this, 
I need to check which one to use and how it can be done WITHOUT A REQUEST)
