# README

This project includes creating a web application.

The client-side includes code written in JS
The final web-page should be updated with different intervals,
from a data base that the server has contact with.
The update can be done through a POST-request 
(so that the client-sides decides when to update)

The server is to be deployed on a cloudservice and be configurated
so that only clients from the StickyBit network can access the page

The communication between the client and server should be according
to HTTP
